# Stock Market Prediction Using LSTM

This project utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict stock market trends and prices. The LSTM model is trained on historical stock data and can provide insights for potential future market movements.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Prepare your dataset in CSV format.
3. Run `python train.py` to train the LSTM model.
4. Use `python predict.py` to make stock market predictions based on the trained model.

## Acknowledgments

This project is based on the principles of LSTM networks and builds upon the work of researchers and developers in the field of machine learning and finance.
